# reviewr annotator demo
> This html demo page supports adding comments to the content. Try highlighing some text (even this line) to add your own!

This page was generated using [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [annotatorjs](http://annotatorjs.org/).  Notes you add to this page are temporary but it should be possible to make a version that saves notes by setting up [storage](http://docs.annotatorjs.org/en/v1.2.x/storage.html) and modifying the [R markdown source files](https://github.com/markdly/reviewr). 

The following image is from a sample page where a comment was added.

On the sample page where the image was taken, the following javascript was run in the chrome developer console: 
```
function view_note(my_note) {
  note_details = my_note.text + "\n" +
    my_note.quote  + "\n" +
    my_note.ranges[0].start  + "\n" +
    my_note.ranges[0].end  + "\n" +
    my_note.ranges[0].startOffset  + "\n" +
    my_note.ranges[0].endOffset;
  console.log(note_details);
};

view_note(jQuery("#mycontent").data('annotator').viewer.annotations[0]);
```
And this was the output:
```
// 2,508 kilometres long according to Wikipedia
// longest
// /p
// /p
// 29
// 36
```

## Adding comments to code, tables and plots

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Comments can be added to tables and code.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Embedded plots can't be commented on directly. Annotate the surrounding text instead.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
