## Adding comments to code, tables and plots

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Comments can be added to tables and code.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Embedded plots can't be commented on directly. Annotate the surrounding text instead.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
