# reviewr minimal example
> This html demo page supports adding comments to the content. Try highlighing some text (even this line) to add your own!

This page was created using a standalone [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) (.Rmd) document.   

Just add `<script src="https://hypothes.is/embed.js" async></script>` to the bottom of the .Rmd file to enable commenting functionality. See the [hypothesis client](https://github.com/hypothesis/client) for more details.   Notes you add to this page are public by default.
